/* PieceScrat - Problem 4

Create a PieceScrat class that extends the Piece class.
It should have the following:
- constant MAX_CRACKS to represent the maximum number of squares it can crack and 
  set it to 2
- member field to represent whether this piece can crack a square or not  (true/false)
- member field to represent the number of attacks its made
- member field to represent the number of recruits its made

- constructor with the parameters required by the superclass plus two
    new paratmeters: one for number of attacks and number of recruits (in that order)
     - calls the super class' constructor (symbol should be set to 'S' by default)     -
     - sets the number of attacks 
     - sets the number of recruits
     - sets the number of squares it cracked to 0
     - adds add "move", "attack" ,"recruit", "spawn", and "crack"
        to the allowable actions array.
- accessors 
    - getNumAttacks, getNumRecruits, getNumCracks
- mutator 
    â€“ increaseNumAttacks - increments number of attacks by 1   
- mutator
    - increaseNumRecruits - increments number of recruits by 1
- mutator
    - increaseNumCracks - increments number of cracks by 1
- implement the speak method:
    - scrat should yell "Aaaahhhh!"
- implement the validMovePath method
    - for now it will return true
- implement the spawn method 
    - it should increase the number of spawns for 
    the object doing the spawning and then return a new PieceScrat
    with the following:
        - symbol - should match values of spawned object but should be lowercase
        - teamColor - should match values of spawned object
        - hidden - should match values of spawned object
        - original - should be set to false
- implement the canSpawn method
    - the piece can spawn as long as it is original and has
    - less than the maximum cracks allowed
- implement the updateAction method
