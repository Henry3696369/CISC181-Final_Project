/*Problem 15: [15 points] - This class will be graded manually by the TAs
Create a new class named Controller. 
This class will interact with the game elements and actions,
and the view used to capture user input.
It should have the following members:
- member field to represnt the game - GameS25 object
- constructor with two parameters:
    - number of rows for the gameboard
    - number of columns for the gameboard
    - calls createGame and assigns itâ€™s return value to the GameS25 property
- method createGame has two parameters: number of rows and number of columns
    and returns a GameS25 object
    this method should create a GameS25 with the following:
        - the GameBoard property should have the number of rows and columns passed in
        - the teamA object should have with 3 Piece objects: 
            a PieceBluehen, a PieceMinion, a PieceScrat
            the color of the team is your choice (don't choose black or white)
        - the teamB object should also have 3 Piece objects: 
            a PieceBluehen, a PieceMinion, a PieceScrat
             the color of the team is your choice (don't choose black or white or 
             the color you chose for teamA)
        - the turn should be set to the color of teamA
    -Note: you can create helper functions as you see fit
- accessor 
    - getGame
- method getTurn 
    has no parameters and returns a string
    indicating whose turn it is
- method getStatus
    has no parameters and returns a string
    with the current message in the Rules instance
    Note: Use the UML diagram to see how to access the Rules
    member message field
- method carryOutAction that three parameters in this order:
    - a start square location, an end square location, and a string for action type
    - this method should create the appropriate action based on action type:
        "move" -> ActionMove
        "attack" -> ActionAttack
        "recruit" -> ActionRecruit
        "spawn" -> ActionSpawn
        "crack" -> ActionCrack
    - the method should check if the action is valid and if so it should perform the action
        (use your methods created in the Action classes!)
    - this method should return whether or not this action was valid

Once you have finished this method, you should be able to use: 
    npm run start 
to play your game with a text based interface.
Play your game to check if it is behaving as described in class.
